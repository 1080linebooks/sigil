      loss of non-well-formed data that has been entered but not saved.

      section in the OPF. We're now going to clean and write the dc and opf namespaces directly

    - Fix for entities not being displayed when loading a file where they are saved as unicode
      in the file itself.

    - Fix the entity display for shy, mdash and ndash.
    - Set modified state on book when page order is changed.

    - fixed a rare issue with no tab opened by default when loading epubs

    - added a small "Donate" button to the toolbar and a related entry in the Help menu 
    - added a .desktop file for the make install target (courtesy of Richard Gibert)
    - this time *really* worked around a Tidy bug that added blank lines to the start of <pre> 
    and <style> elements (issue #655)

    specifies standalone="yes" in the XML declaration (issue #677)

    - added a new toolbar button for turning Tidy cleaning on/off; this option is also available
    from the Tools menu (issue #553)
    - added support for TrueType Collection fonts with extension TTC
    - InDesign (as of CS5) refuses to list the fonts it embeds in the OPF manifest of the epub 
    files it exports, even though the epub standard demands it. This causes Sigil to not pick up
    these fonts when opening such epub files. A workaround has been added that will detect such
    problematic epubs and then load the font files.
    - fixed a rare crash issue when loading epub files

Sigil v0.3.1 2010.11.07
    - added a new "Font Obfuscation" context menu for font files in the Book Browser; the user can
    now select (or de-select) the use of Adobe's or the IDPF's font obfuscation methods; this also
    resolves the problem where Sigil refused to open epub files that use such obfuscated fonts with  
    the message that the epub has DRM
    - fixed a validation issue caused by Sigil using "application/x-font-opentype" as the OPF
    mimetype instead of "application/vnd.ms-opentype"

    - fixed an issue with some UTF-8 characters outside the BMP (usually CJK characters) not being
    saved properly (issue #180)    
    - fixed an issue with certain path types not being correctly updated as a result of the 
    fix for issue #501 (issue #561)
    - the Book Browser now prevents adding files that already exist in the epub
    - previously, when adding external XHTML files through the Book Browser, any files (like CSS 
    stylesheets or images) that were linked from that file were included in the epub under a 
    different name if their original name was "taken"; this caused duplicates so this behavior 
    has changed: files whose names are "taken" are now skipped over (issue #482)    
    - fixed a rare issue that caused incorrect path updates for anchor links pointing to file names
    that were suffixes of other chapter file names, and the anchor had a fragment ID (issue #598)  
    - fixed an issue with the image paths in background-image CSS rules not being updated when
    the path changes (issue #594)
    - Sigil now informs the user that DRMed files cannot be opened, instead of just crashing
    (issue #624)

    - fixed a crash on load (with an error dialog) issue on Linux systems occurring when multiple
    users on the same machine tried to use Sigil (issue #642)

    declared as UTF-16 (issue #617)

Sigil v0.3.0RC1 2010.10.08
    - fixed a validation issue caused by using the American spelling for "acknowledgments" where
    the OPF spec uses the British "acknowledgements" (issue #611)
    - Sigil now uses "application/x-font-ttf" as the media type in the OPF for TrueType fonts
    (issue #609)
    - on Mac OS X, the universal build now includes an x64 version of Sigil, and builds now
    use Cocoa instead of Carbon; support for Mac OS X 10.4 is dropped along with support for
    PowerPC Macs
    - fixed a problem with opening files from the Ubuntu "Open With" menu (issue #524)
    - made Tidy handle common user errors like "&co." in the HTML source instead of "&amp;co."
    - fixed a rare Tidy bug with disappearing spaces when the only whitespace in an element was 
    the newline following a start tag (issue #387)
    - changed the internal DOM engine from Qt's QDom to Xerces; this should also bring numerous
    bug fixes and performance improvements plus a small (~10%) decrease in memory consumption
    (issue #367)
    - updated Qt to 4.7: this should bring a 400%+ performance increase in Book View rendering 
    along with countless smaller performance improvements and bug fixes across the board
    - switched to the MSVC 10 compiler for Windows releases; should bring ~5% general performance 
    improvement 
    - fixed several crash/error problems relating to opening, saving and modifying epub files which
    have onerous file permissions set for internal content files (issue #574)
    - added a workaround for broken epubs created by other epub-producing software which caused
    a crash on certain searches with the Find dialog (issue #548)
    - fixed a problem with Book Browser's "Merge with previous" action if a file was previously 
    deleted from the Book Browser (issue #565)
    - fixed a problem with chapter splits being placed in the wrong reading order if a file was
    previously deleted from the Book Browser (issue #497)

Sigil v0.2.4 2010.08.12.
    - fixed a problem with updating image paths for images with the same filename but coming from
    different parent directories (issue #501)
    - added a new "Merge With Previous" context menu action for XHTML files in the Book Browser

    - newly opened tabs now default to the View of the current tab (issue #468)
    - re-engineered the locations where Sigil stores its work files; the system-provided temp

    especially Macs (issue #404)
    - Sigil now prevents the renaming of files in the Book Browser to filesystem invalid names
    (issue #493)
    - changed the keyboard shortcut that opens the Replace dialog from Cmd+H to Cmd+Shift+F
